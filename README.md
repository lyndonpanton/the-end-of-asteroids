# the-end-of-asteroids
An optional project of the "C# Class Development" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description

You're finally finishing the simplified version of the classic arcade game Asteroids. This is the final increment in your development of this game, so when you're done with this project you'll be done with the game!

In this project, you're making bullets split larger asteroids into smaller asteroids, making bullets destroy asteroids that are small enough, adding a timer to the game, and adding sound effects to the game.

Specifically, your solution needs to:

    Make bullets split asteroids into two smaller asteroids

    Make bullets destroy asteroids that are less than half the original size

    Add a game timer that displays how long the player has been playing

    Stop the game timer when the ship is destroyed

    Play sound effects when the player shoots a bullet, when a bullet collides with an asteroid, and when the ship is destroyed

Testing Your Game

Here are the rubrics we used in previous versions of the course to confirm that the game functioned correctly:

    Bullets split asteroids into two smaller asteroids

    Bullets destroy asteroids that are less than half the original size

    A game timer displays how long the player has been playing

    The game timer stops when the ship is destroyed

    The game plays sound effects when the player shoots a bullet, when a bullet collides with an asteroid, and when the ship is destroyed
